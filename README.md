# Breast-Cancer-Classifier-with-SVM

The Breast Cancer Classifier with SVM project involves developing a machine learning model to classify breast cancer instances into malignant or benign categories using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The project utilizes the breast cancer dataset from the scikit-learn library, which contains features computed from breast cancer cell images.

Key Aspects of the Project:

Data Loading and Preparation:

The dataset consists of features derived from breast cancer cell images.
Data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
Model Selection and Training:

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel is used for classification.
The model is trained on the training data to learn the decision boundary that separates malignant and benign cases.
Model Evaluation:

The trained model is evaluated on the test data to predict the class of cancer.
Accuracy score is calculated to assess the performance of the model.
Results and Insights:

The accuracy of the SVM model is reported, providing insight into the model's effectiveness in classifying breast cancer cases.
The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to assist in the early detection and classification of breast cancer, potentially aiding in more timely and accurate diagnoses.
